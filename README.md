# Assignment-21-Deep-Neural-Network
This is a repository for module 21 which explore in using deep neural network in creating a model with the data from the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup.

<h1>Overview of the analysis</h1>


Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The main purpose of the analysis revolves with creating a model through deep neural network that can be used to predict a value based on the weight of other factors from the previous recordings.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
